        "symptom_text": "The patient has a history of rheumatic fever, a known risk factor for developing rheumatic mitral stenosis.The patient presents with exertional dyspnea, orthopnea, and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, classic symptoms of mitral stenosis.Echocardiography shows thickening and calcification of the mitral valve leaflets with restricted leaflet motion, confirming the diagnosis of rheumatic mitral stenosis.Rheumatic mitral stenosis (I050) - The patient presents with symptoms of exertional dyspnea, orthopnea, and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea along with echocardiographic evidence of thickened and calcified mitral valve leaflets, confirming the diagnosis of rheumatic mitral stenosis.The patient has a loud S1 heart sound and a low-pitched diastolic rumble at the apex, consistent with mitral stenosis. There are no findings suggestive of mitral insufficiency or other valve involvements.The patient is started on diuretics for symptom management and anticoagulants for stroke prevention due to the increased risk of thromboembolism in mitral stenosis.The patient responded well to treatment and was discharged with a follow-up plan for regular echocardiograms to monitor the progression of mitral stenosis.58FemaleCaucasian"
