The patient has a history of G6PD deficiency without anemia.The patient's symptoms and lab results are consistent with G6PD deficiency without anemia. No signs of splenomegaly, polycythemia, myelofibrosis, or immunodeficiency are present.Treatment includes avoiding triggers, such as certain medications and foods, that can exacerbate G6PD deficiency.The patient responded well to treatment and was discharged in stable condition.45MaleCaucasian"

        "symptom_text": "The patient, a 45-year-old male of Caucasian descent, has a history of recurrent infections and unexplained fevers over the past few months.The patient presents with persistent high-grade fever, hepatosplenomegaly, generalized lymphadenopathy, and easy bruising.Laboratory tests revealed pancytopenia with low hemoglobin, platelet count, and white blood cell count. Additionally, the patient showed elevated triglyceride levels and decreased fibrinogen levels.Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is a life-threatening hyperinflammatory syndrome characterized by uncontrolled immune activation. HLH can be triggered by infections, malignancies, or autoimmune disorders. Diagnostic criteria include fever, splenomegaly, cytopenias, hypertriglyceridemia, hypofibrinogenemia, and evidence of hemophagocytosis.Physical examination revealed hepatosplenomegaly with no signs of localized tenderness. The patient's bone marrow biopsy showed evidence of hemophagocytosis, confirming the diagnosis of HLH.The patient was started on dexamethasone and etoposide per HLH-94 protocol. Supportive care measures were initiated to manage the patient's cytopenias and organ dysfunction.The patient showed significant improvement with treatment and was discharged home with close follow-up for monitoring of HLH and its complications.45MaleCaucasian"
