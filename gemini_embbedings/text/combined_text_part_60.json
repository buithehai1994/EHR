In the meantime, start the patient on dexamethasone to reduce brain edema.The patient underwent successful craniotomy and tumor resection. Postoperative course was uneventful, and the patient is recovering well without any neurological deficits.45MaleCaucasian"

Additionally, the patient reports memory issues and episodes of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu.MRI of the brain shows sclerosis in the left temporal lobe with hippocampal atrophy, consistent with temporal sclerosis.Temporal sclerosis (G9381): Temporal sclerosis, also known as mesial temporal sclerosis, is a common cause of temporal lobe epilepsy. It is characterized by hippocampal atrophy and gliosis, often associated with a history of febrile seizures in childhood. The patient's symptoms, seizure semiology, and imaging findings are consistent with temporal sclerosis.The patient's seizures have been refractory to multiple antiepileptic medications. Given the imaging findings and clinical presentation, the diagnosis of temporal sclerosis is clear.The patient has been started on a new antiepileptic medication regimen and is scheduled for follow-up EEG monitoring to assess treatment response.The patient is stable and will be discharged with close outpatient follow-up for medication management and further evaluation of seizure control.42FemaleCaucasian"

The patient reports shooting pain down the spine exacerbated by movement.MRI of the cervical spine shows a syrinx extending from C2 to T5 with associated syringobulbia involving the brainstem. Electromyography (EMG) reveals denervation changes in multiple muscle groups.Syringomyelia and syringobulbia are characterized by the presence of fluid-filled cavities within the spinal cord and brainstem, leading to neurological symptoms such as muscle weakness, loss of sensation, and pain. The MRI of the cervical spine demonstrates a syrinx extending from C2 to T5 with associated syringobulbia involving the brainstem, confirming the diagnosis.The patient's symptoms are consistent with the diagnosis of Syringomyelia and syringobulbia. Neurological examination reveals decreased muscle strength in the upper and lower extremities, reduced sensation in the hands, and signs of brainstem involvement. The EMG findings support the presence of denervation changes in multiple muscle groups.The patient is started on gabapentin for neuropathic pain management and referred to neurosurgery for further evaluation. Surgical intervention may be considered to address the syrinx and alleviate symptoms.The patient's condition is stable at discharge.
