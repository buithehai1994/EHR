No history of post-polio syndrome, Parkinson's disease, or other neurodegenerative disorders.The patient presents with bilateral action tremors that are most noticeable in the hands and arms during voluntary movements. The tremors improve at rest and do not involve other neurological symptoms such as rigidity, bradykinesia, or postural instability.Neurological examination shows rhythmic oscillatory movements with a frequency of 5-9 Hz. MRI of the brain is unremarkable, ruling out structural abnormalities or vascular lesions.Essential tremor (G250): Essential tremor, also known as benign essential tremor, is a common neurological disorder characterized by bilateral, predominantly symmetric action tremors that occur with voluntary movements. The tremors are not associated with other neurological signs and symptoms. The diagnosis is clinical, based on the characteristic presentation of tremors without evidence of other neurological conditions.The patient's tremors are consistent with Essential tremor, showing the classic features of bilateral action tremors without additional neurological deficits. There is no evidence of parkinsonism, dystonia, or other movement disorders.Started the patient on propranolol, a first-line medication for Essential tremor, with a plan for titration based on response. Advised on lifestyle modifications to minimize tremor impact on daily activities.The patient responded well to propranolol with a reduction in tremor severity. Discharged with a follow-up appointment in two weeks for medication review and assessment of treatment response.64MaleCaucasian"
